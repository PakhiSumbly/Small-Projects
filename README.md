Nokia mobile's 90's Snake Game 

# Description
Implementation of the simplest version of the Snake game from the Nokia cell phones of the late 90s.
Starting with a length 5 snake at the bottom left corner and a randomly placed piece of food:
a) When the player hits a key, the snake starts moving right one square per frame, which is about 500ms or so 
Then, the player presses Up, so the snake starts going up, until it eats the food
b) When the Snake hits the food, two things happen:-
1. A new piece of food immediately appears in a new random location 
2. In the NEXT frame, the snake grows by one 
We continue to eat pieces of food until eventually, we will hit the wall or our own Snake body:
 a) Hit the wall
 b) Hit ourselves
